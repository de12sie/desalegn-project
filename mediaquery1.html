            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Programming is a skill that can be acquired by a computer professional that 
			   gives him/her the knowledge of making the computer perform the required operation or task. </p>
            <p> Computer programming is critical if one wants to know how to make the computer perform a 
			    task. Most users of a computer only use the available applications on the computer. 
				These applications are produced by computer programmers. 
				Thus if someone is interested to make such kind of applications, he/she needs 
				to learn how to talk to the computer, which is learning computer programming. </p>
